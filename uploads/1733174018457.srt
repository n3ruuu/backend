(Arthur) Condition Red has been declared.
Condition Red.

00:01:40,059 --> 00:01:42,728
To the Aldrin Autonomous Zone
within the African Republic.

12
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:45,272
An attacking force, likely Blue Cosmos,
has invaded.

13
00:01:45,523 --> 00:01:46,398
Huh!?

14
00:01:46,482 --> 00:01:47,650
Already!?

15
00:01:48,651 --> 00:01:52,988
(Arthur) Pilots, board your units.
All personnel, commence your assigned tasks promptly.

16
00:01:53,072 --> 00:01:56,700
According to reconnaissance, the invading force
is estimated to have launched from Kanaji city.

17
00:01:56,784 --> 00:01:58,994
Anticipated time of encounter: Next 05:05.

18
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:04,208
Establish a fixed line with Compass Headquarters
and the Aldrin Autonomous Government.

19
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:07,545
(Abbie) Operation
Niner 022 proceeding.

20
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,380
Yamato Team, prepare for launch.

Catapult, Alpha Team
from Inductance 20 Futamaru...

22
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,012
(Konoe) The enemy force is estimated
to be squadron-sized. Well, that's the report from the local forces.

23
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:20,099
It's better to overestimate
in situations like this.

24
00:02:20,224 --> 00:02:22,351
The situation seems urgent.

25
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:27,231
Understood. After Freedom penetrates,
Shinn will defend the government facilities.

26
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:28,023
Huh!?

27
00:02:28,107 --> 00:02:31,151
(Kira) Luna Maria and Agnes will
guide the evacuation of civilians while

28
00:02:31,277 --> 00:02:32,570
supporting the Aldrin Defense Force.

29
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:33,654
Again?

30
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:37,825
(Agnes) Captain, I'll handle
the frontline enemies. Please join me!

31
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,618
(Shinn) Captain, I'm going too!

32
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:42,496
(Kira) No, I don't want to
escalate the battlefield.

33
00:02:43,205 --> 00:02:45,541
Harken Team,
we're counting on Millennium.

00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:48,669
You got it, Captain!

35
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:51,755

Admiral Kira Yamato,
permission to board for four.

97

(Murrue) Permission granted. Well done.

98
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:50,656
(Mu) Hmm. All systems
seem fine, no major issues.

99
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:53,283
How about it?
Are you getting used to the new model?

100
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:55,619
(Lunamaria) Yes.
(Shinn) Yeah, well...

101
00:08:57,621 --> 00:08:59,081
(Kira) What's the situation of casualties?

102
00:08:59,665 --> 00:09:04,753
(Murrue) Currently, there are
257 dead, including 68 civilians.

103
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:07,214
It's probably going to increase.

104
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:08,215
Hmm...

105
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:13,345
Once again, no mothership
just a surprise attack with the MS mobile suit force.

106
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:15,764
It's Miquel's network, right?

107
00:09:16,515 --> 00:09:22,521
(Murrue) But his participation is a fake.
The aim is to make ZAFT violate the border.

108
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:27,859
He's confident he can lure them out
by using his own name as bait.

109
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:31,238
Dom, Auel, and Rayha
It's the same trick every time.

110
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:32,239
(Kira) Yeah...

111
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:35,575
(Shinn) How long are they
going to keep this up!?

112
00:09:36,702 --> 00:09:39,913
(Shinn) Planning a mission
without expecting a return...

113
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:42,082
Neither the pilots
nor the units can handle it.

114
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:44,251
(Mu, Murrue) Mm...
(Kira) But it continues...

115
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:45,168
Ugh...

116
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:47,671
That's why it's a problem.

117
00:09:48,714 --> 00:09:52,301
(Mu) It's a deep-rooted problem, actually...

118
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:57,139
(Narration) Cosmic Era 73.

119
00:09:57,514 --> 00:10:02,811
The new battle between Earth and the PLANTs, which began with Break the World, has finally come to an end, evolving in various ways along the way.

120
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:08,442
The Destiny Plan, proposed as a new world system, was also buried with the death of Durandal, the chairman of the council who advocated for it.

121
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:13,238
Everything was left behind, and what remained was deep sadness and confusion.

122
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:17,743
(Jagannath) President Clyne, are you not aware of the damage to our forces?

123
00:10:17,868 --> 00:10:24,249
It was we who suffered from the unilateral invasion of Blue Cosmos!

124
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:28,670
If you consider the feelings of the soldiers,
Captain Yamato's actions are too merciless.

125
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:33,967
It was us who suffered from Blue Cosmos' unilateral invasion!

126
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:39,056
Considering the soldiers' feelings,
Captain Yamato's actions are too merciless.

127
00:10:40,891 --> 00:10:43,143
(Narration) The gap between Naturals and Coordinators

128
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:45,020
remains unfilled.

129
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,273
In addition to the independence movements that occurred in various places,

130
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:53,945
Blue Cosmos, led by Colonel Mikel, repeatedly engaged in guerrilla warfare,

131
00:10:54,363 --> 00:10:59,159
and the conflicts and hatreds continued to smolder in various places.

132
00:11:08,043 --> 00:11:13,340
Concerned about the situation, PLANTs, Orb,
and leaders of the Atlantic Federation

133
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:17,427
established the World Peace Monitoring Organization, Compass,

134
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:22,349
and invited Lacus Clyne as its first president.

135
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:27,062
(Lacus) Chairman Ramtas,
I apologize for causing you concern.

136
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:28,188
(Ramtas) No...

137
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:32,901
But Jagannath and others
have no choice but to be harsh.

138
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,405
I've heard that frustration within the military
is growing.

139
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:37,572
Yes...

140
00:11:37,823 --> 00:11:43,286
As long as Compass remains at the forefront,
there shouldn't be any outbursts.

141
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,163
But there are limits to that too.

142
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:50,377
Even though we understand that holding onto hatred
is foolish,

143
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:53,296
we too can be ruled by emotions.

144
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:57,008
Because what we lost
was too great.

145
00:11:57,342 --> 00:11:58,093
Yes...

146
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:00,429
In the end, what about Mikel in Kanaji?

147
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:06,601
(Ramtas) So, his hiding place is
likely the Eurasian military buffer zone...

148
00:12:06,852 --> 00:12:08,812
That's the most probable...

149
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:09,896
(Ramtas) Hmm...

150
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:14,860
Even though we know that much,
we're unable to act, given our current situation.

151
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:15,986
(Lacus) Yes...

152
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:21,408
(Ramtas) It's been about a month since
the Millennium returned, right?

153
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:25,871
Can the Vice Admiral take a bit of
a break this time?

154
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:28,039
(Lacus) Yes, that's the plan.

155
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:30,417
(Ramtas) That's good to hear.

156
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:31,877
(Blue) Blue

157
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:36,923
(Ramtas) However,
though I've met him several times,

158
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:40,844
he's a mysterious man,
Captain Yamato.

159
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:45,974
He gives off a quiet impression,
quite unlike someone suited for the battlefield.

160
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:51,062
But now, it seems he's trying to bear
the contradictions of this war alone.

161
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:53,940
He's gentle, you see...

162
00:12:54,024 --> 00:12:55,317
I see.

163
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:02,782
(Lacus Monologue) That's why, quickly,
we must set him free.

164
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:06,745
Before kindness breaks him...

165
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:11,208
(Jagnanort) Your Excellency Tao's?

166
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:15,295
Yes, Chairman of the Defense Committee.

167
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:17,506
Then, here,

168
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:23,803
(Cagalli) The above is the offer from
Empress Aura of the Foundation.

169
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:26,932
I think the same has reached
the PLANTs as well.

170
00:13:27,057 --> 00:13:31,436
(Toya) It seems that country has a fairly
precise grasp on Mikael's whereabouts.

171
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:34,397
I believe there's significance
in cooperating, but...

172
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:41,071
Indeed, Toya, there are two sides
to every coin.

173
00:13:41,196 --> 00:13:43,615
(Lacus) What's the return, then?

174
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,201
(Cagalli) It's about joining
the COMPASS.

175
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:51,498
As a trigger to be recognized by
the international community as an independent nation, perhaps?

176
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:52,999
Perhaps so.

177
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,001
Since its independence,
the Foundation has seen

178
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:58,630
remarkable development in both
technology and economy,

179
00:13:58,922 --> 00:14:01,383
but its relationship with Eurasia
is not good.

180
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:06,555
After all, various regions of Eurasia
have been experiencing a storm of independence as a result.

181
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:08,765
(Toya) It's the "Foundation Shock," right?

182
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:13,853
(Lacus) Why was such
remarkable recovery possible?

183
00:14:13,979 --> 00:14:17,399
I've heard it's due to the skill
of Prime Minister Orhfe Ram Taos.

184
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:21,111
Former Chairman Durandal
acknowledged that talent.

185
00:14:22,153 --> 00:14:25,240
Is the President doubting
the Destiny Plan!?

186
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:27,867
No, it's not quite like that...


187
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:34,666
We rejected Chairman Durandal's vision of the future.

188
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:38,878
However, there must be many people
attracted to that possibility.

189
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:41,965
We cannot deny even those people.

190
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:43,675
That's true.

191
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:47,053
And now, by allowing participation in COMPASS,

192
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:51,891
there is also the possibility of further straining
relations between COMPASS member states and Eurasia.

193
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:53,268
That's right.

194
00:14:53,602 --> 00:14:59,024
But Orb also owes them for the theft of Freedom
six months ago.

195
00:14:59,107 --> 00:14:59,941
Hmm...

196
00:15:00,275 --> 00:15:01,943
(Kagali) Is Lacus against it?

197
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:02,819
Ah...

198
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:08,533
Please, give me a moment to think.

199
00:15:10,285 --> 00:15:13,747
(Kira) Huh!? But Lacus, that's...

200
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:17,500
No, Kira, it's not because it's wanted.

201
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:18,418
Huh!?

202
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:20,837
I also want it.

203
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,796
Ah...

204
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:24,674
To fight alongside you.

205
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:29,971
Lacus!

206
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:45,278
Am I... not trusted after all?

207
00:15:45,362 --> 00:15:46,279
Huh?

208
00:15:46,404 --> 00:15:50,575
No, Captain. Ultimately, I always end up fighting alone.

209
00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:54,037
But, by doing so, we manage to minimize casualties.

210
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:56,122
That's true, but!

211
00:15:56,331 --> 00:15:59,000
Then what are we here for?

212
00:15:59,084 --> 00:15:59,918
Well...

213
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:03,421
Captain, you said it back then, right?

214
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:07,133
That time, you told me
let's fight together...

215
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,095
Yeah...

216
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:15,016
(Shin) I was moved by those words
and joined the Compass.

217
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:18,228
So? Are you still hesitating?

218
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:22,315
It's not like that! It's just that...

219
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:25,652
I want to be more useful,
or rather, for you, Kira-san...

220
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:28,697
Shin, you're Justice,
you've been entrusted with that.

221
00:16:28,822 --> 00:16:30,699
Not being trusted... that's...

222
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:33,535
(Agnes) Trusted?
As if that's even possible.

223
00:16:33,618 --> 00:16:36,705
For someone once called the Freedom Killer.

224
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:38,373
Freedom Killer?

225
00:16:38,456 --> 00:16:42,293
Oh, you didn't know?
How delightful.

226
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:47,590
Someone who might shoot you in the back anytime.
If it were me, I wouldn't want them beside me.

227
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:48,967
Agnes!

228
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:52,178
Come on, give it up,
Justice.

229
00:16:52,637 --> 00:16:55,515
Even if you have it,
it's just wasted potential.

230
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:59,144
Back at the academy, both in skills and evaluation,
I was superior, wasn't I?

231
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:01,146
(Shin) Hmm...
(Lunamaria) Hey, Agnes!

232
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:05,900
During the war, I always found it strange,
you being a pilot, a Face and all.

233
00:17:05,984 --> 00:17:11,364
But in the end, it was just the right pawn
for Chairman Durandal, wasn't it?

234
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:12,490
Ugh!

235
00:17:12,824 --> 00:17:14,492

Can it be resolved, Captain Heinlein?

252
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:11,508
Sigh... As the designer, I have no choice but to do it myself.

253
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:13,676
I'm astonished by the incompetence of the development department.

254
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,095
Setting up and adjusting for Freedom will also take time,

255
00:18:16,179 --> 00:18:18,348
and the bug in the autonomous control program is also a headache.

256
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:21,142
I'll handle the program,

257
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:23,770

263

Welcome, Your Highness.

342
00:24:37,018 --> 00:24:40,271
I am Orphé Lam Tao, Prime Minister of the Foundation.

343
00:24:40,521 --> 00:24:42,565
We extend our warmest welcome to you.

344
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:45,568
I am Lacus Clyne, Chairman of Compass.

345
00:24:45,735 --> 00:24:48,154
It's an honor to meet you.

346
00:24:50,531 --> 00:24:51,449
Ah...

347
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:55,244
Huh?

348
00:24:56,913 --> 00:24:57,747
Ah...

349
00:25:02,335 --> 00:25:04,629
(Orphé) Finally, we meet.

350
00:25:04,754 --> 00:25:06,172
Lacus Clyne.

351
00:25:06,255 --> 00:25:07,089
Huh?

352
00:25:08,049 --> 00:25:09,550
(Lacus) And you are?

353
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:11,802
(Orphé) I am your destiny,

354
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:15,264
the one who will guide the world with you.

355
00:25:15,723 --> 00:25:16,724
Huh?

356
00:25:18,226 --> 00:25:19,227
(Kira) Lacus.

357
00:25:19,393 --> 00:25:20,228
(Lacus) Ah!

358
00:25:21,395 --> 00:25:22,230
(Orphé) Hmph.

359
00:25:32,073 --> 00:25:33,824
(Orphé) An annoying one.

360
00:25:34,075 --> 00:25:35,159
(Kira's Monologue) What?

(Aura) Welcome to the Foundation.

365
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:07,900
I am Aura Mah-Hybar.

366
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:11,737
This time, the Compass's swift response is greatly appreciated.

367
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:18,119
I am truly honored to receive your audience, Your Majesty Aura.

368
00:26:18,202 --> 00:26:23,040
We are also greatly troubled by the partisans of Míchel in our country.

369
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:26,335
We have made several appeals to Eurasia,

370
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:29,505
but it seems that they are taking time to respond.

371
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,465
There is no choice.

372
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:35,344
They have many internal problems to deal with.

373
00:26:35,845 --> 00:26:40,766
(Aura) I am grateful to you. Please protect our people.

374
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:46,188
Your words are too kind. I will do my utmost.

375
00:26:46,439 --> 00:26:50,401
I have prepared a modest reception for us to converse.

376
00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:55,406
Please, take your time and share your stories there.

377

(Shura) Huh! Shh! Hmph!

380

(Ingrit) They are our country's Imperial Guards.

381
00:27:15,468 --> 00:27:19,388
Are they the rumored Black Knights...?

Well, well...
Can't beat Shura, huh?

387
00:27:33,361 --> 00:27:36,572
Could you give me some pointers, Captain Yamato?

388
00:27:36,697 --> 00:27:39,492
(Shin, Lunamaria) Huh!?
(Kira) No, I...

389
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:43,120
Oh, the captain can't use a sword, huh?

390
00:27:43,245 --> 00:27:46,957
(Lidell) Maybe being in the Compass isn't all that great after all?

391

(Daniel) We proved that the other day.

392

Those living in the present, those seeking paths to the future,

None wish for conflict. However, conflict persists.

474
00:32:40,334 --> 00:32:44,046
Coordinators and Naturals are both human after all.

475
00:32:44,922 --> 00:32:49,927
It's sad. People find reasons to fight over trivial matters.

(Lacus) Yes...

It's the unjust society that is the real issue.

Ah...

483
00:33:08,862 --> 00:33:12,991
(Orpheus) Because of unfair wealth distribution, because lives aren't equally valued,

484
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:17,871
Because it's not a society where everyone is fairly evaluated, people fight.

485
00:33:18,288 --> 00:33:23,669
If society could present a place where everyone is needed, a fair and equal society,

486
00:33:23,752 --> 00:33:26,046
Overcoming the differences between Coordinators and Naturals,

487
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:28,757
The world will surely move towards a better direction...

488
00:33:29,258 --> 00:33:30,634
That's what I believe.

489
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:36,306
That's a wonderful thought. Indeed, it might be so.

490
00:33:36,682 --> 00:33:41,520
To hear you say that, Princess, gives me confidence as one who bears the responsibility of governance.

Huh? What's wrong?

504
00:34:31,862 --> 00:34:34,615
(Agnes) I feel sorry for the captain...

505
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:38,786
He's dancing around with other men in front of everyone,

506
00:34:39,161 --> 00:34:42,164
Even though he's heading to a dangerous battlefield soon...

507
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:45,542
(Kira) Well, both of those are his job.

508
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:47,419
(Agnes) Why aren't you angry!?

509
00:34:47,669 --> 00:34:51,298
She's taking advantage of the captain's kindness, isn't she?

510
00:34:53,509 --> 00:34:57,137
Look at me! You want to get back at her, don't you?

511
00:34:57,262 --> 00:34:58,639
What...

512
00:34:59,056 --> 00:35:01,892
What are you trying to do!

513
00:35:02,893 --> 00:35:05,312
Why do you like someone like that?

514
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:09,233
I wouldn't do that. I wouldn't send the person I love to the battlefield

515
00:35:09,358 --> 00:35:11,944
while I stay safe and just watch.

516
00:35:12,069 --> 00:35:14,238
(Kira) That's not what it's about!
(Agnes) Huh...

517
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:16,114
You don't understand anything!

518
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:19,117
Ugh...

519
00:35:21,578 --> 00:35:22,412
Huh?

520
00:35:24,998 --> 00:35:25,833
Ah...

521
00:35:35,008 --> 00:35:36,677
Tao... Your Excellency...

522
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:42,599
It's a good moon. In the darkness, it equally brings peace, the supreme light.

523
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:45,018
Don't you think so?

524
00:35:45,352 --> 00:35:47,145
I'm sorry, perhaps another day.

525
00:35:47,229 --> 00:35:49,940
Do you have the right to pursue her?

526
00:35:50,023 --> 00:35:50,858
Huh...

527
00:35:51,233 --> 00:35:54,152
Forgive me, but you are not worthy of her.

528
00:35:55,279 --> 00:36:00,868
Destruction, hatred, and death. Those are the things you create.

529
00:36:01,034 --> 00:36:01,910
Isn't that right?

530
00:36:02,035 --> 00:36:02,870
Huh...

531
00:36:06,456 --> 00:36:10,335
By defeating Chairman Durandal, what did you take from the world?

532
00:36:11,128 --> 00:36:14,214
Order, peace, a society without conflict.

533
00:36:14,298 --> 00:36:19,136
Can you say that you are working to compensate for what people have lost?

534
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:20,512
What...

535
00:36:20,762 --> 00:36:24,641
The world presented with the Destiny Plan can never go back.

536
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,894
You understand that too, right?

537
00:36:27,019 --> 00:36:31,982
Everyone wants to decide what they can do and what is desired.

538
00:36:32,274 --> 00:36:34,943
She is the guiding light for such a world.

539
00:36:35,068 --> 00:36:39,197
Standing beside her is someone who also guides the world.

540
00:36:39,406 --> 00:36:40,157
Hmm...

541
00:36:40,449 --> 00:36:42,034
I can do it.

542
00:36:42,117 --> 00:36:42,951
Huh...

543
00:36:43,076 --> 00:36:46,496
A world she desires, without the chain of battles.

544
00:36:46,622 --> 00:36:50,125
Creating a world of stability and harmony is what I can do!

545
00:36:50,834 --> 00:36:51,877
That's impossible...

546
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:56,340
You can't do it. You can only fight.

547
00:36:56,465 --> 00:36:58,008
I...

548
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:02,512
What will you do when peace comes, with those bloodstained hands?

549
00:37:02,971 --> 00:37:06,350
Are you planning to take her hand with those blood-stained hands?

550
00:37:06,475 --> 00:37:07,225
Urgh...

551
00:37:16,068 --> 00:37:17,069
(Shura) Huh!?

552
00:37:17,194 --> 00:37:18,195
Who's there!?

553
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,614
[Crying]

554
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:25,494
Hey, am I not pretty? Am I not charming?

555
00:37:25,911 --> 00:37:28,288
Why am I not good enough?

556
00:37:29,456 --> 00:37:33,251
You are beautiful, Valkyrie of Moonlight.

557
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:38,548
[Sobbing]

558
00:37:42,511 --> 00:37:43,637
[Sigh]

559
00:37:47,099 --> 00:37:49,226
Shin's an idiot, a brat...

560
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:01,530
(Orpheus) Can't sleep?

561
00:38:01,905 --> 00:38:02,864
Lord Orpheus.

562
00:38:02,948 --> 00:38:08,286
(Orpheus) Please, think of me as nothing more than a shadow cast by the moon.

563
00:38:11,832 --> 00:38:15,669
(Lacus) How can we end all of this?

564
00:38:15,961 --> 00:38:16,712
Huh?

565
00:38:16,878 --> 00:38:23,343
Why is it so difficult for everyone to live without fighting and forgiving each other?

566
00:38:24,553 --> 00:38:25,554
Huh...

567
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:29,599
We can end it. We can.

568
00:38:32,853 --> 00:38:33,687
Ah.

569
00:38:34,354 --> 00:38:39,401
I am here to help you, only for that reason.

570
00:38:40,152 --> 00:38:43,238
Who are you?

571
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,574
I am Orphé Lam Tao.

572
00:38:45,866 --> 00:38:50,287
I am the one who, together with you, can restore peace to this world.

573
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:51,204
Ah...

574
00:38:56,293 --> 00:38:58,879
Is that so? But...

575
00:38:58,962 --> 00:39:02,007
I was born for that purpose.

576
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,593
To fulfill the mission given to me.

577
00:39:04,926 --> 00:39:07,471
And so are you.

578
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:12,851
[Sobbing]

579
00:39:15,312 --> 00:39:19,691
(Aura) Come, children, to a new future.

580
00:39:20,442 --> 00:39:26,490
As your destinies dictate, as everything was predetermined from the beginning.

581
00:39:27,491 --> 00:39:30,202
The world awaits you.

582
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:34,581
(General) We have obtained details about the Blue Cosmos guerrillas our country has seized.

583
00:39:34,956 --> 00:39:37,793
Mikhail has occupied the Eldora Fortress ruins.

584
00:39:37,918 --> 00:39:42,547
Through underground tunnels, he has confirmed access to Eurasian territory.

585
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:46,676
There may also be something on the Foundation's side.

586
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,261
That seems to be the case.

587
00:39:49,971 --> 00:39:56,686
Then, while prioritizing the evacuation guidance of civilians, the Foundation's military will contain the enemy group.

588
00:39:56,937 --> 00:40:00,774
The objective is the arrest and restraint of Colonel Mikhail.

589
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:06,071
We will urge surrender to the Blue Cosmos combatants, minimizing loss of life.

590
00:40:06,154 --> 00:40:09,032
The front-line command will be handled by the Archangel.

591
00:40:09,491 --> 00:40:12,536
(General) The Blue Cosmos shall not set foot within our borders.

592
00:40:12,661 --> 00:40:17,249
But the same applies to the Compass. Access is restricted to the Eldora district only.

593
00:40:17,374 --> 00:40:18,708
(Lacus) Understood.

594
00:40:19,251 --> 00:40:24,422
(General) If they cross the military demarcation line, it will be considered an act of aggression and we will attack immediately.

595
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:28,093
Whether it's Compass or Foundation.

596
00:40:28,343 --> 00:40:30,679
[Missile launch sound]

597
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:33,306
[Alert sound] (Chandra) Multiple heat sources approaching, more than thirty!

598
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:37,435
Helldart, Wombat, Eagle Stern, commence interception!

599
00:40:37,561 --> 00:40:41,565
[Missile launch, machine gun fire sound]

600
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:46,278
(Kira) Shin, Agnes, Hilda will neutralize enemy MS. We're heading for Mikhail's command center.

601
00:40:46,361 --> 00:40:48,613
Here's the plan.

602
00:40:48,738 --> 00:40:49,739
(Shin and others) Understood!

603
00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:07,507
(Mu) Shikishima team, support Justice Gundam. Mahoroba team, follow me!

604
00:41:08,133 --> 00:41:12,137
[Intense gunfire, missile launch sound]

605
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:15,473
[Beam firing, explosion sound]

606
00:41:30,906 --> 00:41:32,574
[Alert sound]

607
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:40,498
(Kira) Get down!

608
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:43,210
[Agni cannon firing sound]

609
00:41:46,296 --> 00:41:47,547
There's more of that!

610
00:41:54,054 --> 00:41:56,890
(Resident) Help us! Ahh!

611
00:41:56,973 --> 00:41:59,643
[Crowd noise]

612
00:41:59,768 --> 00:42:00,602
Huh?

613
00:42:02,938 --> 00:42:05,899
[Explosion]

614
00:42:05,982 --> 00:42:06,691
Ahh!

615
00:42:06,775 --> 00:42:09,611
[Explosions happening throughout the city]

616
00:42:10,737 --> 00:42:11,571
(Kira and others) Huh!?

617
00:42:11,947 --> 00:42:13,657
(Orphe) How despicable!

618
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:18,119
(Shula) Vehicles and infantry units, fall back!

619
00:42:18,203 --> 00:42:20,080
(Griffin) What the hell are they doing!

620
00:42:20,372 --> 00:42:21,206
Argh!

621
00:42:27,629 --> 00:42:29,631
You!

622
00:42:43,645 --> 00:42:46,773
(Orphe) Immediately dispatch rescue teams to attend to the wounded in the Eldora city area!

623
00:42:47,148 --> 00:42:48,316
Is that okay?

624
00:42:49,401 --> 00:42:54,447
It's unavoidable. Rescue operations are permitted only in the Eldora district.

625
00:42:55,073 --> 00:42:55,907
Hmph...

626
00:42:56,616 --> 00:42:57,575
Understood.

627
00:43:04,833 --> 00:43:06,543
Initiate the operation.

628
00:43:07,085 --> 00:43:08,670
Yeah, leave it to us.

629
00:43:08,837 --> 00:43:09,671
Roger.

630
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:11,464
Let's go!

631
00:43:19,931 --> 00:43:22,600
Fall into darkness, Kira Yamato.

632
00:43:23,852 --> 00:43:24,769
Ugh!?

633
00:43:25,353 --> 00:43:26,187
Hah!

634
00:43:34,237 --> 00:43:35,238
Ugh...

635
00:43:45,707 --> 00:43:46,791
Captain?

636
00:43:46,916 --> 00:43:47,751
Hm?

637
00:43:56,926 --> 00:43:58,094
Mikhail?

638
00:44:00,555 --> 00:44:01,389
Hmph

639
00:44:01,473 --> 00:44:04,476
[Missile launch sound]

640
00:44:06,019 --> 00:44:08,438
[Beam firing, explosion sound]

641
00:44:12,525 --> 00:44:14,861
(Shin) Captain, what's wrong!?

642
00:44:14,944 --> 00:44:17,530
Secure Mikhail. Shin, provide cover!

643
00:44:17,614 --> 00:44:19,699
Huh? But...

644
00:44:19,783 --> 00:44:21,159
(Kira) He's getting away!

645
00:44:22,869 --> 00:44:26,414
(Mu) What's wrong, Kira? You're getting close to the border. What are you doing!

646
00:44:26,706 --> 00:44:29,334
(Himeko) Yamato team leader's aircraft is heading towards Charlie at 10-5.
Heading into Eurasian territory.

647
00:44:29,709 --> 00:44:31,669
What did you say!?

648
00:44:31,878 --> 00:44:33,254
What's going on, Ki...
Yamato team leader!

650
00:44:36,508 --> 00:44:38,676
(Kira) Mikhail spotted. Capturing him!

651
00:44:38,802 --> 00:44:39,636
Huh!?

652
00:44:41,304 --> 00:44:43,473
Colonel Flagga, report the situation!

653
00:44:46,601 --> 00:44:48,937
(Soldier) Freedom is nearing the military border!

654
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:52,482
(General) What's going on? Didn't he know about the pre-negotiations!

655
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:56,694
(Commander) Warning, Freedom. Your aircraft is approaching Eurasian Federation territory.

656
00:44:56,778 --> 00:44:58,655
Change course immediately!

657
00:44:58,947 --> 00:45:00,573
(Orphe) Why to Eurasia...

658
00:45:00,782 --> 00:45:02,367
(General) What's happening, Chairman!

659
00:45:02,492 --> 00:45:05,870
(Lacus) Freedom, please turn back immediately, Kira!

660
00:45:05,954 --> 00:45:08,456
(General) Warning shots, commence! (Lacus) Please wait!

661
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:12,544
[Linear cannon, vulcan, beam firing sound]

662
00:45:15,672 --> 00:45:17,257
Still resisting, are they!

663
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:19,050
(Shin) Captain! (Mu) Kira, stop!

664
00:45:19,175 --> 00:45:20,218
(Murrue) No, Kira!

665
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:22,137
End it here!

666
00:45:23,763 --> 00:45:25,432
[Full burst firing sound]

667
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:27,809
This is a clear act of aggression!

668
00:45:27,892 --> 00:45:31,229
Kira, Kira! Can't you hear us!?

669
00:45:31,354 --> 00:45:34,691
(Kira) It's Mikhail. I can't let him escape here!

670
00:45:34,941 --> 00:45:35,817
Ngh...

671
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:39,237
(Orphe) This is not our intention. It's Captain Yamato acting on his own!

672
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:42,407
He must have planned to lure in the Compass from the start!

673
00:45:42,532 --> 00:45:44,909
If that's the case, then we'll also take countermeasures!

674
00:45:44,993 --> 00:45:46,453
So it has come to this, Princess!

675
00:45:46,578 --> 00:45:49,247
Please wait. There must be a reason for this.

676
00:45:49,372 --> 00:45:50,540
Captain Yamato...

677
00:45:50,665 --> 00:45:53,793
He's clearly suffering from delusions or perhaps rebellion.

678
00:45:53,877 --> 00:45:54,961
That's impossible!

679
00:45:55,044 --> 00:45:57,422
Unfortunately, the current situation indicates otherwise.

680
00:45:58,089 --> 00:46:02,177
If the Compass cannot control the situation, then leave it to us!

681
00:46:02,927 --> 00:46:05,805
All our diplomatic efforts will be in vain!

682
00:46:06,139 --> 00:46:08,683
It's counterproductive to have casualties due to the actions of a single individual!

683
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:10,977
By one person's rampage!

684
00:46:11,352 --> 00:46:12,479
(Rio) Princess Lacus...

685
00:46:13,605 --> 00:46:14,689
Ugh...

686
00:46:16,816 --> 00:46:18,443
Understood...

687
00:46:19,068 --> 00:46:21,154
Please stop Kira...

688
00:46:21,863 --> 00:46:22,489
Huh?

689
00:46:23,198 --> 00:46:27,035
(Orphe) Does that mean you're authorizing an attack on Vice Admiral Yamato?

690
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:28,536
(Lacus) Yes...

691
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:29,662
Lacus!?

692
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:30,955
(Mu) Wait, Chairman Clyne!

693
00:46:31,039 --> 00:46:32,373
[Communication noise]

694
00:46:32,457 --> 00:46:35,710
There's strong radio interference. All communications are cut off.

695
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:37,629
(Albert) It's jamming by the NJ Dazzler.

696
00:46:37,712 --> 00:46:39,172
This isn't yet operational.

697
00:46:39,255 --> 00:46:41,049
How did they solve the control of quantum spattering!?

698
00:46:41,132 --> 00:46:42,926
This isn't from Eurasia or the Blue Cosmos...

Guh!

707
00:47:15,875 --> 00:47:17,210
Stop it, why!?

708
00:47:17,669 --> 00:47:20,380
Why? Look around you.

709
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:27,512
Wha... what's going on?

710
00:47:28,429 --> 00:47:30,181
(Shura) I'll kill you!

711
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:35,853

715
00:48:05,842 --> 00:48:08,219
Don't get in my way!

716
00:48:11,264 --> 00:48:13,308
You don't seem to learn.

717
00:48:13,433 --> 00:48:17,103
I've already proven that you're not worth my time!

718

Shin! Ugh...

719
00:48:29,532 --> 00:48:31,242
These guys, just as I thought!

720
00:48:31,326 --> 00:48:33,828
It's a trap. Archangel, move forward!

They're quite far back from the Eurasian army. Why are they there?

729
00:49:08,363 --> 00:49:10,198
(Daniel)
Ah, were we seen?

730
00:49:10,281 --> 00:49:14,369

    No way!
    Is that...!?

739
00:49:42,188 --> 00:49:44,190
[Reports flying around]
It's from our homeland...

740
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:48,361

741
00:49:48,444 --> 00:49:49,278
(Lacus and others) Huh!?

742
00:49:49,362 --> 00:49:50,488
What's the target!?

00:49:50,905 --> 00:49:51,739
(Commander) Here.

744
00:49:51,823 --> 00:49:54,117

The beams aren't working!?

758
00:50:45,209 --> 00:50:47,795
Is this the rumored FemTech armor!?

759
00:50:48,171 --> 00:50:50,548

Detach the engines!
Abandon the ship, all hands evacuate!

806
00:53:54,357 --> 00:53:57,276
All hands, evacuate! Ugh!

807

830
00:56:03,611 --> 00:56:06,072
Because that's your destiny!

831
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:07,114
What!?

00:56:08,282 --> 00:56:11,285
[Stinger rapid fire sound]

[Missile, beam firing sound]

837
00:56:44,276 --> 00:56:45,361

    Let's do it!
    I can!

839
00:56:58,624 --> 00:57:00,376

850
00:57:42,918 --> 00:57:44,003
Let's get out of here, Kira!

851
00:57:44,128 --> 00:57:46,338

    Ah...
    No way...

855
00:58:18,829 --> 00:58:19,663
Huh?

856
00:58:23,042 --> 00:58:23,876
Hmph.

857
00:58:27,463 --> 00:58:31,467
[Sobbing]

858
00:58:32,927 --> 00:58:33,844
Kira...

859
00:58:34,303 --> 00:58:38,641
(Female Announcer) "Four days after the tragedy in Eldoa,
radiation levels on-site remain high."

860
00:58:38,724 --> 00:58:43,103
"Relief efforts from major nations involved
have not progressed as hoped."

861
00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:48,067
"With the NJC facility back in operation,
nightmares have once again erupted on the surface."

862
00:58:48,150 --> 00:58:52,947
"The world trembles, and voices of protest
are growing louder day by day."

863
00:58:53,489 --> 00:58:55,783
(Tohya) "We have confirmed wreckage
thought to be from the Archangel"

864
00:58:55,908 --> 00:58:58,661
"at 1.5 kilometers east of the second ground zero."

865
00:58:58,744 --> 00:59:04,291
"Freedom, Justice, and other MS units
engaged in operations have yet to be found."

to our calls for them."

caught in the explosion..."

868

(Lament) "So, President Klein is safe then?"

869
00:59:13,676 --> 00:59:16,428
(Kagali) "Yes,
according to reports from the Millennium."

871
00:59:20,307 --> 00:59:21,934
Have you contacted the PLANTs?

872
00:59:22,059 --> 00:59:22,893
(Lament) No...

873
00:59:23,018 --> 00:59:24,520
What are you going to do about it!

874
00:59:24,770 --> 00:59:27,606
We've received strong protests from Eurasia.

875
00:59:27,731 --> 00:59:32,528
It's all because Captain Yamato violated the agreement
by crossing the military boundary.

876
00:59:32,611 --> 00:59:36,198
But that doesn't justify firing a nuclear weapon.

877
00:59:36,323 --> 00:59:39,243
That would be an act of betrayal
against all humanity.

878
00:59:39,326 --> 00:59:41,870
I can't accept Captain Yamato's actions either.

879
00:59:41,996 --> 00:59:47,918
There are too many mysteries according to the reports.
I have no idea what happened!

880
00:59:48,043 --> 00:59:49,795
The truth is shrouded in darkness.

881
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:54,133
As long as Captain Yamato or Mikael remain silent
while they're alive...

882
00:59:54,216 --> 00:59:59,096
It's convenient, isn't it?
No one can be held accountable.

883
00:59:59,179 --> 01:00:01,181
What are you trying to say?

884
01:00:01,307 --> 01:00:06,437
(Foster) We're really asking whether Captain Yamato acted on his own
or not, you see.

885
01:00:06,562 --> 01:00:10,274
This incident provides a perfect opportunity
for the PLANTs to intervene in Eurasian territory...

886
01:00:10,357 --> 01:00:12,109
Please stop with these baseless accusations!

887
01:00:12,192 --> 01:00:14,570
Kiracould never do such a thing!

888
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:16,989
Lady Cagalli...

889
01:00:17,239 --> 01:00:18,490
(Foster) I see...

890
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:22,911
Then our country has no intention
of further involvement with the Compass.

891
01:00:23,037 --> 01:00:27,875
(Lament) Neither do we. We're tired
of having our insides probed like this.

892
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,918
[Communication interruption sound]
(Cagalli) Huh...

893
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:32,254
[Sigh]

894
01:00:39,595 --> 01:00:41,180
I can't accept it.

895
01:00:44,308 --> 01:00:45,434
[Sigh]

896
01:00:47,186 --> 01:00:49,396
Why hasn't he come back?

897
01:00:49,855 --> 01:00:51,315
Shinn is such an idiot!

898
01:00:51,398 --> 01:00:54,651
(Konoe) I see. So, it's true
that the Foundation...

899
01:00:54,777 --> 01:00:57,988
(Albert) Given the timing of the jamming,
there's a 92% chance it's Black's doing.
It's the Black Knights' work.

900
01:00:58,072 --> 01:00:59,531
It's the Black Knights' doing.

901
01:00:59,615 --> 01:01:04,328
Ah, black, just like the Black Knights... Wait, what!?

902
01:01:04,453 --> 01:01:07,664
So, are you saying that the Foundation
was behind that nuclear attack!?

903
01:01:07,790 --> 01:01:08,999
Ah! Mmgh...

904
01:01:09,124 --> 01:01:12,336
But we have no means
to prove that.

905
01:01:12,461 --> 01:01:15,089
(Albert) The Millennium has been ordered to return,
we have zero mobile suits available.

906
01:01:15,172 --> 01:01:17,966
The Archangel has been shot down too,
the crew's survival is hopeless.

907
01:01:18,592 --> 01:01:24,014
I wonder...
Will they die so easily? Those people?

908
01:01:24,473 --> 01:01:28,102
(Female announcer) "Foundation,
including the Eldoa region, 50,000 dead."

909
01:01:28,227 --> 01:01:31,772
"Injured and missing
estimated to be over 100,000."

910
01:01:31,897 --> 01:01:34,024
"Eurasian forces are preparing for retaliation."
[Sound of opening and closing door]

911
01:01:34,149 --> 01:01:36,110
"All troops are on standby..."
[Sound of turning off the monitor]

912
01:01:36,235 --> 01:01:38,153
Are you both done?

913
01:01:38,237 --> 01:01:39,947
(Shin) Uh, yes.

914
01:01:41,865 --> 01:01:44,034
[Sound of turning on the monitor]
"Mama!"

915
01:01:44,326 --> 01:01:47,788
(Female announcer) "Compass's activities
have already been frozen for the time being..."

916
01:01:47,913 --> 01:01:49,039
[Sound of turning off the monitor]
Huh!?

917
01:01:50,416 --> 01:01:53,293
Is it true
that Compass's activities are frozen!?

918
01:01:53,419 --> 01:01:59,633
Yes, Cagalli seems to have tried her best,
but right now, criticism from around the world is intense.

919
01:02:00,342 --> 01:02:02,594
(Shin) Those guys... Damn!

920
01:02:02,803 --> 01:02:06,598
(Asuran) The only thing left is the Millennium.
現在 オーブに入港している

921
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:09,059
We haven't informed them of our situation.

922
01:02:10,185 --> 01:02:11,437
What about Lacus...?

923
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:15,441
It seems she escaped on a Foundation shuttle...

924
01:02:15,941 --> 01:02:19,153
(Kira) She... she betrayed us.

925
01:02:25,242 --> 01:02:28,328
(Asuran) We found something concerning in the terminal investigation.

926
01:02:29,413 --> 01:02:32,124
(Marieu) This... is Empress Aura?

927
01:02:32,207 --> 01:02:36,795
This is her from 19 years ago, when she was at the Mendel Genetic Research Institute.

928
01:02:36,879 --> 01:02:38,505
19 years ago!?

929
01:02:39,923 --> 01:02:41,592
Her research theme was...

930
01:02:41,717 --> 01:02:44,386
...to create a species surpassing Coordinators.

931
01:02:44,470 --> 01:02:45,345
(All) What!?

932
01:02:46,805 --> 01:02:52,102
(Control Officer) Deflection Ring 1, 3, and 6
deployed to target locations as planned.

933
01:02:52,186 --> 01:02:54,605
Target alignment correction plus 2.3.

934
01:02:54,730 --> 01:03:00,444
Requiem launch countdown at
T-minus 60 minutes. System operating normally.

935
01:03:00,944 --> 01:03:05,657
(Asuran) It's likely everything was part of Aura's and their plan.

936
01:03:10,204 --> 01:03:12,206

    Including the nuclear attack...
    What!?

937
01:03:12,289 --> 01:03:15,918
At least they have an excuse now for launching the nukes.

938
01:03:16,376 --> 01:03:18,545
Requiem, ready for launch.

939
01:03:18,629 --> 01:03:20,464
(Orphe) May God bless us.

940
01:03:20,547 --> 01:03:22,591
[Sound of Requiem launching]

941
01:03:22,716 --> 01:03:25,844
(Asuran) They now have the pretext
to strike Eurasia.

942
01:03:26,678 --> 01:03:30,682
[Sound of a clock chiming]

943
01:03:31,141 --> 01:03:35,145
[Sound of Requiem firing, destruction, explosion]

944
01:03:42,277 --> 01:03:43,779
[Sound of a door opening]
(Toya) Lady Cagalli!

945
01:03:43,862 --> 01:03:44,613
Hmm?

946
01:03:44,696 --> 01:03:47,324
(Erika) Lieutenant Zala,
come to the control room immediately!

947
01:03:47,658 --> 01:03:48,909
(Konoa) Gather information!

948
01:03:49,034 --> 01:03:52,162
Establish communication lines with
the Compass headquarters and Orb government!

949
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:54,331
(Erika) Moscow...

950
01:03:54,790 --> 01:03:58,710
Is this the Foundation's retaliation... already?

951
01:03:59,169 --> 01:04:01,129
(Shin) A nuclear... attack?

952
01:04:01,213 --> 01:04:03,090
No, this is...

953
01:04:06,260 --> 01:04:07,636
It's Requiem...

954
01:04:08,053 --> 01:04:11,014
(Eurasian Federation Representative) Wasn't Requiem
supposed to be dismantled!?

955
01:04:11,098 --> 01:04:14,434
(East Asian Republic Representative) This is a blatant violation
of the ceasefire agreement by PLANT!

956
01:04:14,518 --> 01:04:17,813
(Eurasian Federation Representative) We absolutely cannot
tolerate such retaliation!

957
01:04:17,938 --> 01:04:19,231
(Foster's Secretary) Mr. President...

958
01:04:19,648 --> 01:04:21,858
(Foster) What do you mean? Connect me immediately!

959
01:04:21,942 --> 01:04:23,277
[Electronic sound]

960
01:04:23,402 --> 01:04:25,696
"We have been driven from the surface."

961
01:04:26,029 --> 01:04:28,782
"By the hateful nuclear
weapon unleashed by Naturals,"

962
01:04:29,658 --> 01:04:32,869
"Our desires for peace and stability
have once again been trampled by the stubborn Naturals."

963
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:36,540
"Why!?"

964
01:04:36,665 --> 01:04:37,874
"Our nation, as a national policy,
accepted the Destiny Plan proposed by former PLANT Supreme Council Chairman,"

965
01:04:38,375 --> 01:04:42,588
"Mr. Gilbert Durandal."

966
01:04:42,713 --> 01:04:47,092
"A society completely just and equal
through genetic manipulation,"

967
01:04:47,509 --> 01:04:51,263
"Accepting our roles engraved in our genes,
we overcame poverty,"

968
01:04:51,513 --> 01:04:56,018
"And achieved miraculous reconstruction
after the previous war."

969
01:04:56,393 --> 01:04:58,478
"But lazy humans
are not pleased with that!"

970
01:04:58,604 --> 01:05:03,817
"They deny evolution,
envy others, and hold onto past grudges,"

971
01:05:03,942 --> 01:05:08,113
"Killing each other in their
ugly emotions."

972
01:05:08,614 --> 01:05:12,951
"While living on the peaceful land of Earth,
they are like parasites consuming its benefits greedily!"

973
01:05:13,076 --> 01:05:15,954
"We ask!"

974
01:05:16,330 --> 01:05:22,085
"Why must we walk together
with such ignorant fools?"

975
01:05:22,169 --> 01:05:24,046
"Coordiantors living on PLANT,"

976
01:05:24,171 --> 01:05:29,176
"We are your brothers."

977
01:05:30,719 --> 01:05:33,305
"We, like you, are the beings
to inherit the future of human evolution!"

978
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:35,724
"We are the ultimate Coordinators
created through genetic manipulation."

979
01:05:36,266 --> 01:05:40,854
"We, like you, are beings who will inherit
the future of human evolution!"

980
01:05:41,521 --> 01:05:45,567
"We are also the ultimate Coordinators
created through genetic manipulation."

981
01:05:45,692 --> 01:05:47,069
"We are the 'Accords'!"

982
01:05:47,444 --> 01:05:52,908
"The role engraved in our genes
is to guide the world as mediators of humanity."

983
01:05:53,909 --> 01:05:56,328
"We were born for that purpose."

984
01:05:56,953 --> 01:05:58,830
"One of your leaders,"

985
01:05:58,914 --> 01:06:02,167
"President Lacus Clyne, is also one of us!"

986
01:06:02,668 --> 01:06:06,505
"She is now with us as a leader
who guides humanity."

987
01:06:07,631 --> 01:06:12,928
"Our will is her will,
and our desires are her desires!"

988
01:06:13,303 --> 01:06:16,348
"Let's go together,
brothers of the Coordinators!"

989
01:06:16,932 --> 01:06:20,769
"The era of contradictions and tyranny
by the old humanity has ended."

990
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:24,815
"This is a notice to all nations of Earth."

991
01:06:24,898 --> 01:06:29,861
"Immediately disarm and
approve and execute the Destiny Plan!"

992
01:06:30,028 --> 01:06:31,863
"The deadline is 5 days."

993
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:35,992
"For those forces unwilling to accept us,
under the name of Lacus Clyne,"

994
01:06:36,118 --> 01:06:40,956
"sanctions will be imposed by Requiem."

995
01:06:41,707 --> 01:06:44,918
"The fires of Armageddon
will rain down upon them..."

996
01:06:45,335 --> 01:06:47,003
What is this...

997
01:06:48,213 --> 01:06:49,047
(Asuran) Kira!

998
01:06:50,924 --> 01:06:52,384
(ZAFT Soldier) Chairman to the bridge!

999
01:06:52,843 --> 01:06:57,139
(Lament) Mrs. Jule Canaar, former representative, you are safe.

1000
01:06:57,347 --> 01:07:02,018
However, domestic turmoil may require us
to remain passive for the time being.

1001
01:07:02,102 --> 01:07:04,271
Understood, Chairman.

1002
01:07:04,479 --> 01:07:08,942
In the worst-case scenario, Requiem's targeting
may once again be directed towards the PLANTs.

1003
01:07:09,025 --> 01:07:12,696
(Lament) For now, we must assess the situation
and remain in hiding.

1004
01:07:12,904 --> 01:07:14,781
What are the arrangements for that?

1005
01:07:14,990 --> 01:07:17,659
It's difficult to say we are fully prepared.

1006
01:07:17,909 --> 01:07:23,290
There is a supply facility for the resistance entrusted by Lady Lacus located in the abandoned Boaz.

1007
01:07:23,373 --> 01:07:25,959
(Diarka) We will go there...
(Lament) Hmm... understood.

1008
01:07:26,042 --> 01:07:30,088
I apologize for keeping you waiting alone for so long, Your Highness.

1009
01:07:30,589 --> 01:07:32,507
If you can apologize.

1010
01:07:32,632 --> 01:07:37,345
Please let me return as soon as possible if you can apologize.

1011
01:07:37,763 --> 01:07:38,764
Return?

1012
01:07:39,222 --> 01:07:41,767
Your rightful place is here.

1013
01:07:42,434 --> 01:07:45,937
(Aura) That is also your mother's will.

1014
01:07:46,021 --> 01:07:46,855
Huh?

1015
01:07:47,189 --> 01:07:48,482
Mother's?

1016
01:07:51,401 --> 01:07:53,361
(Asuran) The Destiny Plan selects people by genetics...

1017
01:07:53,487 --> 01:07:56,782
...and assigns roles based on aptitude.

1018
01:07:56,990 --> 01:07:58,283
Durandal and Aura...

1019
01:07:58,408 --> 01:08:02,329
...oversee this system and created leaders to guide the people.

1020
01:08:02,621 --> 01:08:04,456
That's the Accord.

1021
01:08:04,539 --> 01:08:05,373
What!?

1022
01:08:07,834 --> 01:08:10,545
(Aura) You were born for the people.

1023
01:08:10,629 --> 01:08:14,466
To be loved by all and to show them the way.

1024
01:08:14,549 --> 01:08:15,383
Huh?

1025
01:08:15,467 --> 01:08:18,094
That's how I created you.

1026
01:08:19,012 --> 01:08:21,973
Me... created!?

1027
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:27,020
(Asuran) And the key figures of the Accord are Orpheus Ram Tao...

1028
01:08:27,354 --> 01:08:29,356
...and Lacus...

1029
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:30,565
(All) Huh!?

1030
01:08:31,191 --> 01:08:32,400
Lacus!?

1031
01:08:33,401 --> 01:08:38,240
(Aura) The two of you should stand at the pinnacle of all humanity, the final pair of pieces to be combined.

1032
01:08:38,365 --> 01:08:42,118
These are the last pieces that will be joined together.

1033
01:08:42,994 --> 01:08:47,499
(Orpheus) You and I will rule this world together.

1034
01:08:48,083 --> 01:08:49,751
Do you feel it? [Resonance sound]

1035
01:08:50,669 --> 01:08:53,296
Together... with you?

1036
01:08:54,005 --> 01:08:58,176
We are drawn to each other and bound by fate.

1037
01:08:59,636 --> 01:09:02,264
(Asuran) That's why they took Lacus.

1038
01:09:02,514 --> 01:09:05,100
Because she was necessary for their plan.

1039
01:09:07,394 --> 01:09:08,395
(Kira) Lacus!

1040
01:09:09,104 --> 01:09:10,981
Huh!? Ugh...

1041
01:09:13,316 --> 01:09:16,444
The one I love is not you!

1042
01:09:16,736 --> 01:09:18,613
Ugh! Hmph...

1043
01:09:19,155 --> 01:09:21,783
Are you concerned about Kira Yamato?

1044
01:09:22,075 --> 01:09:24,995
Unfortunately, he is no longer in this world.

1045
01:09:25,078 --> 01:09:25,996
Huh!?

1046
01:09:26,121 --> 01:09:28,915
(Orpheus) You were told you could strike him down, weren't you?

1047
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:32,043
[Sobbing]

1048
01:09:32,168 --> 01:09:33,128
Kira!

1049
01:09:33,420 --> 01:09:35,672
Anyway, he is no longer necessary...

1050
01:09:35,755 --> 01:09:37,674
In the world to come.

1051
01:09:38,633 --> 01:09:40,135
(Lacus) Because I'm needed...

1052
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:43,597
Because I'm needed, it's not out of love!

1053
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:46,182
I'm needed because I love you!

1054
01:09:46,266 --> 01:09:47,100
Huh?

1055
01:09:47,183 --> 01:09:51,062
Stop with the nonsensical Natural-like words!

1056
01:09:51,479 --> 01:09:52,606
Launch!

1057
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:56,693
Shura, Ingrit, I'm counting on you to protect Mother and the princess!

1058
01:09:58,153 --> 01:10:02,741
(Asuran) According to the information, there's currently a military coup underway in the PLANTs.

1059
01:10:02,908 --> 01:10:07,370
Details are unclear, but we've lost contact with the chairwoman and other council members.

1060
01:10:07,495 --> 01:10:08,288
(Shin) What!?

1061
01:10:08,371 --> 01:10:13,627
But we're stuck here with no means of action—no mobile suits, no ships.

1062
01:10:13,752 --> 01:10:18,465
So basically, we're all sitting ducks here...

1063
01:10:18,548 --> 01:10:23,261
It's speculative, but it seems the Accord can read our minds.

1064
01:10:23,345 --> 01:10:24,971
(Shin) What!?
(Asuran) Probably...

1065
01:10:25,096 --> 01:10:28,224
They might be able to influence our minds.

1066
01:10:28,558 --> 01:10:30,393
Is that why the captain...?

1067
01:10:32,312 --> 01:10:37,108
(Female Announcer) "Following total surrender to Earth's nations, the Foundation advises disarmament and the execution of the Destiny Plan."

1068
01:10:37,192 --> 01:10:40,737
"If this advice is not followed, they will immediately launch Requiem."

1069
01:10:41,029 --> 01:10:45,492
"If this advice is not followed, Requiem will be launched immediately."

1070
01:10:45,700 --> 01:10:50,121
"In that case, further statements warn that civilian evacuation will not be permitted."

1071
01:10:50,205 --> 01:10:54,209
[Sound of a shower]

1072
01:10:54,501 --> 01:10:58,880
(Asuran) Let's rescue Lacus. That's the only way...

1073
01:10:59,130 --> 01:11:03,635
To break through this situation and stop the PLANTs, we need her words.

1074
01:11:05,345 --> 01:11:06,221
It's useless.

1075
01:11:06,304 --> 01:11:07,263
(All) Huh?

1076
01:11:07,430 --> 01:11:08,473
(Marieu) Kirakun?

1077
01:11:08,598 --> 01:11:09,891
It's all the same anyway...

1078
01:11:10,350 --> 01:11:12,310
No matter what we do...

1079
01:11:12,394 --> 01:11:16,731
(Search Soldier) ZAFT fleet detected. Our fleet is deploying to the right flank, left flank, and front.

1080
01:11:16,815 --> 01:11:19,275
(Communications Soldier) The left flank of the fleet has been fired upon!

1081
01:11:19,359 --> 01:11:22,404
Each ship, evasive maneuvers to the right! We're being fired upon on the right flank too!

1082
01:11:22,529 --> 01:11:25,365
[Sound of ship gunfire]

1083
01:11:25,448 --> 01:11:28,827
(Commander) Don't cluster together, or we'll take a direct hit from Requiem!

1084
01:11:29,077 --> 01:11:34,082
[Sound of Requiem firing, explosion]

1085
01:11:41,047 --> 01:11:46,886
(Kira) In the end, it's all repeating. After all that suffering, hesitation, fighting...

1086
01:11:46,970 --> 01:11:49,431
Fighting, fighting!

1087
01:11:49,723 --> 01:11:52,350
But nothing changes...

1088
01:11:52,892 --> 01:11:56,604
Is it because I'm wrong!?

1089
01:11:56,730 --> 01:11:57,605
Kira...

1090
01:11:57,689 --> 01:12:01,484
That's why Lacus chose him over me!

1091
01:12:02,110 --> 01:12:03,778
I'm no good!

1092
01:12:04,279 --> 01:12:07,574
I can't give her anything she wants!

1093
01:12:07,907 --> 01:12:12,078
I can't even make her smile!

1094
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:17,208
I can't make her happy! That's why she betrayed me!

1095
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:18,376
Hmph!
[Sound of a punch]

1096
01:12:18,460 --> 01:12:19,753
(All) Ahh!

1097
01:12:20,295 --> 01:12:22,547
Stop your useless whining!

1098
01:12:22,672 --> 01:12:24,632
It's always about you, you, you!

1099
01:12:24,758 --> 01:12:28,720
You never think about her feelings at all!

1100
01:12:28,845 --> 01:12:33,641
Enough! If you hate fighting so much, then just stay here and rot!

1101
01:12:33,767 --> 01:12:39,647
You don't understand anything... I don't want to hear that from you!

1102
01:12:39,773 --> 01:12:40,690
Nngh!

1103
01:12:40,899 --> 01:12:41,816
Whoa!

1104
01:12:42,067 --> 01:12:42,984
Ugh!

1105
01:12:43,276 --> 01:12:45,612
Do you think you're the only one fighting!?

1106
01:12:45,695 --> 01:12:49,032
It can't be helped, can it? Because you're weak!

1107
01:12:49,115 --> 01:12:50,492
Don't mess with me!

1108
01:12:50,658 --> 01:12:53,536
So if things don't go your way, you just give up on carrying the weight of the world alone!?

1109
01:12:53,661 --> 01:12:55,997
Some hero you are!

1110
01:12:56,122 --> 01:12:57,582
What a joke!

1111
01:12:57,874 --> 01:12:58,708
No!

1112
01:12:59,667 --> 01:13:00,502
Whoa!

1113
01:13:02,337 --> 01:13:03,171
Ugh!

1114
01:13:04,464 --> 01:13:06,466
Stop it, Athrun! The captain...

1115
01:13:06,549 --> 01:13:07,884
Sound of punching

1116
01:13:07,967 --> 01:13:09,260
Gah!

1117
01:13:09,761 --> 01:13:10,678
Damn it!

1118
01:13:10,804 --> 01:13:11,971
Just let it happen.

1119
01:13:13,056 --> 01:13:16,434
Fixing up a pathetic guy like you is what friends are for.

1120
01:13:16,559 --> 01:13:18,019
Ugh... Grrrr!

1121
01:13:18,144 --> 01:13:19,354
I'll do it!

1122
01:13:19,479 --> 01:13:21,606
I have to do it!

1123
01:13:21,773 --> 01:13:23,942
Even if I hate it, I'll do it desperately!

1124
01:13:24,359 --> 01:13:28,655
Why don't you say it, ask for it, from someone!

1125
01:13:28,780 --> 01:13:30,865
What can you do alone!?

1126
01:13:30,990 --> 01:13:32,534
Sound of punching
Gwaaah!

1127
01:13:33,493 --> 01:13:34,327
Aah!

1128
01:13:35,745 --> 01:13:36,746
Hah, hah

1129
01:13:38,832 --> 01:13:41,000
(Kira) I want to see Lacus...

1130
01:13:41,334 --> 01:13:42,168
Huh?

1131
01:13:42,877 --> 01:13:43,795
Lacus...

1132
01:13:44,462 --> 01:13:47,799
I just want her to be next to me, smiling...

1133
01:13:48,174 --> 01:13:52,220
I don't know anymore
what I should do!

1134
01:13:53,972 --> 01:13:58,017
(Athrun) Lacus has changed a lot
since we last met.

1135
01:13:58,143 --> 01:13:58,977
Huh?

1136
01:13:59,394 --> 01:14:04,357
Thinking you can't be happy or do anything
unless you do things like this.

1137
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:05,275
Ah...

1138
01:14:05,483 --> 01:14:08,319
(Athrun) The Lacus I know
wouldn't say things like that.

1139
01:14:08,444 --> 01:14:09,612
(Everyone) Huh!?

1140
01:14:10,196 --> 01:14:11,281
(Everyone) Ah...

1141
01:14:12,157 --> 01:14:16,369
Lacus wanted the world
to be at peace.

1142
01:14:16,494 --> 01:14:19,205
But she didn't think someone could just
give peace to her as a gift, right?

1143
01:14:19,330 --> 01:14:22,083
Wasn't she looking for someone
to walk towards that with her?

1144
01:14:22,208 --> 01:14:26,671
Someone to walk together with, towards that goal?

1145
01:14:27,088 --> 01:14:30,091
Even if it's one step at a time,
even if it's small...

1146
01:14:31,009 --> 01:14:34,762
Does she still feel that way now?
Lacus...

1147
01:14:35,054 --> 01:14:37,390
If you're worried, go and ask her in person.

1148
01:14:37,473 --> 01:14:38,308
Huh?

1149
01:14:38,808 --> 01:14:40,518
Let's go, Kira.

1150
01:14:41,477 --> 01:14:42,937
Let's save Lacus.

1151
01:14:43,354 --> 01:14:44,522
Together.

1152
01:14:45,106 --> 01:14:48,276
Because there are things that can't be conveyed
unless you put them into words.

1153
01:14:49,652 --> 01:14:50,570
Yeah!

1154
01:14:55,617 --> 01:14:57,076
(Meer) Analyzing the trajectory,

1155
01:14:57,202 --> 01:15:00,747
We've narrowed down the area where the
Foundation's shuttle is headed.

1156
01:15:00,872 --> 01:15:04,500
Combined with Orb's information,
Lacus is probably...

1157
01:15:04,584 --> 01:15:07,795
It's troublesome, the Artemis Fortress...

1158
01:15:07,879 --> 01:15:12,133
If we use the Triton and Blue's quantum network,
we can pinpoint Lacus's location.

1159
01:15:12,425 --> 01:15:15,511
Once we get close enough,
we'll know her whereabouts, right?

1160
01:15:15,595 --> 01:15:19,682
But only if Lacus still has it with her...

1161
01:15:19,766 --> 01:15:24,562
(Shin) What about the ship?
We don't even have MS that can fight properly.

1162
01:15:24,854 --> 01:15:30,401
We might be able to procure a ship,
although it might be a bit rough.

1163
01:15:30,693 --> 01:15:33,738
As for the MS,
I might be able to manage something.

1164
01:15:36,115 --> 01:15:38,034
It was entrusted to me by the Asaha representative,

1165
01:15:38,117 --> 01:15:42,372
and it was being used for performance evaluation
experiments on new fusion reactors and equipment.

1166
01:15:42,747 --> 01:15:45,833
I didn't anticipate this kind of situation,

1167
01:15:46,459 --> 01:15:47,543
Destiny!

1168
01:15:47,627 --> 01:15:48,962
Freedom...

1169
01:15:49,045 --> 01:15:51,839
(Erika)
The propulsion and armaments are still the same as before,

1170
01:15:51,965 --> 01:15:55,260
but the control system has been updated
to the latest version.

1171
01:15:55,385 --> 01:15:59,222
It might be uncertain to counter the Black Knights,

1172
01:15:59,514 --> 01:16:03,184
(Shin) No, with this, we can take on guys like them!

1173
01:16:11,025 --> 01:16:13,361
[Sound of wire being ejected and fixed]

1174
01:16:13,736 --> 01:16:17,240
[Sound of wire being reeled in]

1175
01:16:25,915 --> 01:16:26,833
Here it comes!

1176
01:16:27,125 --> 01:16:29,711
[Electronic sound]

1177
01:16:31,045 --> 01:16:33,047
[Alert sound]
Captain, it's an injection attack.

1178
01:16:33,923 --> 01:16:35,633
I see...

1179
01:16:35,717 --> 01:16:38,344
(Jamie) Crew members,
evacuate the ship immediately.

1180
01:16:38,469 --> 01:16:44,183
Repeat, emergency alert, emergency alert,
toxic gas detected on ship's B deck!

1181
01:16:44,309 --> 01:16:45,268
What's going on!?

1182
01:16:47,645 --> 01:16:49,939
(Maryuu) Don't move!
(Arthur) Ye--s!

1183
01:16:51,274 --> 01:16:54,027
My calculations were
off by two minutes, Captain Yamato.

1184
01:16:55,611 --> 01:16:57,071
Captain Konoe...?

1185
01:16:57,572 --> 01:17:00,950
Preparations for departure are complete,
Colonel Ramius.

1186
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:04,329
Such hazardous things
are not necessary.

1187
01:17:09,167 --> 01:17:10,335
(Shin) Don't move...

1188
01:17:11,502 --> 01:17:13,880
Put your hands up and drop the gun.

1189
01:17:17,467 --> 01:17:19,761
(Lunamaria) Hmph! Take that!
(Shin) Uwah!

1190
01:17:20,303 --> 01:17:22,472
[Sound of elbow strike and knee kick]
(Shin) Ugh, guwah!

1191
01:17:22,555 --> 01:17:23,389
Ugh...

1192
01:17:23,890 --> 01:17:26,184
Ha! Luna, me, me!

1193
01:17:26,934 --> 01:17:28,061
Shin!?

1194
01:17:28,144 --> 01:17:30,897
Haa, it hurts... Huh?

1195
01:17:33,733 --> 01:17:35,109

    Shin!
    Uwah!

1196
01:17:37,904 --> 01:17:42,909
(Lunamaria) Idiot, idiot, seriously!
I thought you were dead!

1197
01:17:45,036 --> 01:17:49,123
Oww... I'm going to die... Really going to die...

1198
01:17:49,248 --> 01:17:51,834
[Lunamaria sobbing]

1199
01:17:52,335 --> 01:17:54,712
(Orphe) The Millennium
has been hijacked?

1200
01:17:54,796 --> 01:17:59,133
(Soldier) Yes, there are notices
to the PLANTs and the Atlantic Federation.

1201
01:17:59,300 --> 01:18:04,514
Even satellite images show increased movement of people and objects around the dock.

1202
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:07,975
Hmph, Orb, as expected...

1203
01:18:09,477 --> 01:18:12,814
(Kira) We'll infiltrate Artemis Fortress
and rescue Lacus.

1204
01:18:12,897 --> 01:18:16,442
(Asuran) Using Mirage Colloid
to approach and evade enemy detection.

1205
01:18:16,526 --> 01:18:18,361
Nicole's tactics...

1206
01:18:18,444 --> 01:18:21,447
(Konoe) We'll break through
the main fleet and head to the moon.

1207
01:18:21,572 --> 01:18:23,574
(Maryuu)
We'll be the bait, I see.

1208
01:18:23,658 --> 01:18:26,494
(Albert) If they find out who we are,
they'll attack Orb immediately.

1209
01:18:26,577 --> 01:18:28,413
Before that, we'll neutralize Requiem.

1210
01:18:28,496 --> 01:18:32,166
The Requiem main body is shielded,
making destruction by conventional firepower impossible.

1211
01:18:32,250 --> 01:18:34,919
The beam relay points are
camouflaged with Mirage Colloid,

1212
01:18:35,002 --> 01:18:38,172
so their location cannot be predicted
until they are launched.

1213
01:18:38,256 --> 01:18:40,883
Except for one place, though...

1214
01:18:41,050 --> 01:18:44,929
Only the first relay point
is directly above the Requiem's firing line.

1215
01:18:45,012 --> 01:18:47,306
Right before launch, for sure!

1216
01:18:52,311 --> 01:18:54,355
(Konoe) Then, Captain Ramius.

1217
01:18:54,647 --> 01:18:55,481
Huh?

1218
01:18:55,773 --> 01:18:57,316
No!
It can't be...

1219
01:18:57,608 --> 01:19:04,115
This ship is neither Compass nor ZAFT now.
It's a rebel, a pirate, if you will.

1220
01:19:04,282 --> 01:19:09,328
Someone who knows how to fight
like that should sit in this seat.

1221
01:19:09,412 --> 01:19:10,872
Understood...

1222
01:19:11,330 --> 01:19:14,041
Then, Colonel Konoe,
I entrust you with the position of Vice-Captain.

1223
01:19:14,333 --> 01:19:16,419

    With pleasure!
    Huh? Oh, really?!

1224
01:19:16,794 --> 01:19:20,590
(Neumann) All sections checked.
Main engine output increasing.

1225
01:19:20,798 --> 01:19:22,133
30 seconds to rated output.

1226
01:19:22,550 --> 01:19:23,801
Preparations for departure complete.

1227
01:19:24,093 --> 01:19:25,303
(Konoe) Release the mooring ropes.

1228
01:19:25,428 --> 01:19:27,054
(Neumann) Water jet engaged.

1229
01:19:27,138 --> 01:19:29,515
[Engine ignition sound]

1230
01:19:34,896 --> 01:19:38,983
Leaving the harbor, Millennium advancing, first combat speed.

1231
01:19:49,368 --> 01:19:53,539
(Aegis Ship Commander) Halt! Millennium, immediately cease your movement!

1232
01:19:53,706 --> 01:19:55,875
Failure to comply will result in your ship being attacked.

1233
01:19:55,958 --> 01:19:58,794
Maintain course, both sides to second combat speed!

1234
01:19:58,878 --> 01:20:00,880
Huh? Wh-What!? But!

1235
01:20:02,089 --> 01:20:05,885
(Aegis Ship Commander) Permission to fire! Captain, understood?

1236
01:20:06,010 --> 01:20:06,802
Yes!

1237
01:20:06,928 --> 01:20:09,722
One hundred shots, all missed, is a tradition of the Todaka Sea Admiral!

1238
01:20:10,056 --> 01:20:11,599
Commence firing!

1239
01:20:11,682 --> 01:20:15,686
[Main cannon and missile launch interception sound]

1240
01:20:16,562 --> 01:20:18,564
[Explosion and impact sound]

1241
01:20:21,526 --> 01:20:23,402
Hmph... What a farce.

1242
01:20:24,362 --> 01:20:28,449
(Orphe) It seems Orb has chosen to ignore our warning.

1243
01:20:28,533 --> 01:20:32,954
What nonsense. There should still be time for a response!

1244
01:20:33,162 --> 01:20:36,666
We are currently consulting the parliament regarding your country's demands.

1245
01:20:36,958 --> 01:20:41,212
(Orphe) Transparent trickery. We are aware of the movements of the Millennium as well.

1246
01:20:42,213 --> 01:20:45,132
In 10 minutes, we will launch the Requiem towards your country.

1247
01:20:45,424 --> 01:20:49,095
Wait! The Millennium has been hijacked by someone!

1248
01:20:49,220 --> 01:20:50,137
Just a moment ago, in PLANT...

1249
01:20:50,221 --> 01:20:53,724
I told them, if there's any movement, shoot!

1250
01:20:53,849 --> 01:20:56,519
(Kagali) It's a misunderstanding! We have nothing to do with this...

1251
01:20:56,978 --> 01:21:00,565
Sooner or later, you're a country that must be shot at anyway.

1252
01:21:00,815 --> 01:21:01,649
Hmph.

1253
01:21:01,732 --> 01:21:06,904
(Kagali) Hasten the evacuation of all citizens, and Orb's military must support this with all its might!

1254
01:21:07,029 --> 01:21:10,157
Government functions will be relocated to the Onogoro Island air defense facility.

1255
01:21:10,241 --> 01:21:11,576
Lady Kagali...

1256
01:21:11,659 --> 01:21:13,578
Hurry! We only have 10 minutes!

1257
01:21:17,540 --> 01:21:19,500
Engage maximum power, disengage from the water!

1258
01:21:19,584 --> 01:21:21,586
Main thrusters, engage!

1259
01:21:21,836 --> 01:21:23,254
[Jet sound]

1260
01:21:23,546 --> 01:21:24,880
Millennium, launch!

1261
01:21:35,433 --> 01:21:38,978
Ah! Captain, oh...
The Foundation!

1262
01:21:39,061 --> 01:21:41,314
(Orph)
Prepare to fire the Requiem!

1263
01:21:41,689 --> 01:21:43,983
The target is Orb's capital, Orphat.

1264
01:21:44,275 --> 01:21:48,571
(Announcement) Citizens, please follow the instructions and evacuate immediately.

1265
01:21:50,615 --> 01:21:52,700
I'm counting on you, Tohya.

1266
01:21:52,825 --> 01:21:55,286
Lady Kagali... Please take care.

1267
01:21:55,411 --> 01:21:56,662
This way, please.

1268
01:21:58,539 --> 01:21:59,749
(Miriaria) Representative Asaha!

1269
01:22:00,041 --> 01:22:02,418
Strike Rouge, Cavalier Airfreed 2, ready to go! Hurry!

1270
01:22:02,543 --> 01:22:04,086
Understood.

1271
01:22:04,211 --> 01:22:05,338
Got it.

1272
01:22:08,132 --> 01:22:10,176
As I suspected, they won't be fooled!

1273
01:22:10,301 --> 01:22:14,805
They intended to attack Orb from the beginning; they just needed an excuse!

1274
01:22:21,687 --> 01:22:26,442
(Kagali Monologue) Father, please protect the people... Kira!

1275
01:22:28,402 --> 01:22:29,904
Farewell, Orb.

1276
01:22:30,154 --> 01:22:32,281
(Kira) Foundation, do you copy?

1277
01:22:32,365 --> 01:22:34,867
This is the Minenia, Kira Yamato.

1278
01:22:34,992 --> 01:22:37,328
(Communications Officer) Receiving broadcast on the international distress channel.

1279
01:22:37,703 --> 01:22:38,746
What!?

1280
01:22:38,829 --> 01:22:42,208
Too bad.
I'm still alive.

1281
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:46,212
Even though you tried to kill me by sacrificing your own people.

1282
01:22:46,337 --> 01:22:47,713
What's going on, Shura!?

1283
01:22:47,838 --> 01:22:49,924
Nonsense... In that situation!?

1284
01:22:50,007 --> 01:22:53,344
(Kira) You guys aren't leaders guiding humanity.

1285
01:22:53,427 --> 01:22:55,012
You're just murderers!

1286
01:22:55,096 --> 01:22:58,683
We know the truth. We have evidence.

1287
01:22:58,766 --> 01:23:03,104
We'll expose it to the world.
You've lost!

1288
01:23:03,229 --> 01:23:07,983
Whatever Accord or whatever, we'll crush the schemes of the slaughterers!

1289
01:23:08,109 --> 01:23:09,819
If I may...

1290
01:23:09,944 --> 01:23:10,778
Mother!

1291
01:23:10,903 --> 01:23:12,863
Kill that failure!

1292
01:23:12,988 --> 01:23:18,744
The target is the Minenia!
Fire! I command it!

1293
01:23:19,078 --> 01:23:21,038
High-energy reaction on the far side of the moon!

1294
01:23:21,163 --> 01:23:23,374
Activate Tanhauser, emergency braking!

1295
01:23:23,666 --> 01:23:25,751
[Tanhauser activation sound]

1296
01:23:26,544 --> 01:23:30,548
[Requiem firing sound]

1297
01:23:37,471 --> 01:23:40,474
[Explosion sound]

1298
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:42,852
Fire!

1299
01:23:43,352 --> 01:23:47,356
[Tanhauser firing, engine thrust sound]

1300
01:23:49,442 --> 01:23:52,027
(Search soldier) Lost the Minenia due to electromagnetic pulse!

1301
01:23:52,111 --> 01:23:53,237
(Dracus) Damn it!

1302
01:23:54,697 --> 01:24:00,953
Inform all units! Henceforth, we will exercise our full strength for the defense of our homeland!

1303
01:24:01,036 --> 01:24:02,913
National defense directive issued!

1304
01:24:03,539 --> 01:24:07,668
Establish tactical link with Compass Council countries, Minenia Eternal!

1305
01:24:07,835 --> 01:24:12,173
The military shall continue evacuation guidance with civilian safety as the top priority.

1306
01:24:17,928 --> 01:24:23,642
Even though it's been converted to nuclear power, it's surprising they kept such an old machine.

1307
01:24:23,726 --> 01:24:27,855
I like it though. The control system of the Zaku is easy to use.

1308
01:24:28,189 --> 01:24:30,399
Isaac Jule, Duel, launch!

1309
01:24:30,733 --> 01:24:33,068
Dearka Elsman, Buster, launch!

1310
01:24:37,114 --> 01:24:39,658
(Kira) Well then, Maru-san, here I go.

1311
01:24:39,784 --> 01:24:42,286
(Maryu) Yes, I'll definitely get Lacus-san.

1312
01:24:42,411 --> 01:24:43,162
Yes.

1313
01:24:44,789 --> 01:24:45,623
(Kira) Shin.

1314
01:24:46,248 --> 01:24:47,208
Ah...

1315
01:24:47,291 --> 01:24:49,001
I'm counting on the Minenia.

1316
01:24:49,543 --> 01:24:50,377
Huh?

1317
01:24:52,087 --> 01:24:52,838
Yes!

1318
01:24:53,297 --> 01:24:54,882
Well done, Boz.

1319
01:24:55,299 --> 01:24:57,426
Really, you're so simple.

1320
01:24:57,718 --> 01:24:58,427
Heh heh.

1321
01:24:58,552 --> 01:24:59,720
Was it weird?

1322
01:24:59,845 --> 01:25:00,846
No.

1323
01:25:01,055 --> 01:25:02,723
Isn't it okay?

1324
01:25:03,015 --> 01:25:03,849
Hmm...

1325
01:25:08,729 --> 01:25:09,814
(Ingrid) Why...


1326
01:25:09,939 --> 01:25:10,815
Yes?

1327
01:25:10,898 --> 01:25:14,944
Why does the princess not accept her destiny?

1328
01:25:16,111 --> 01:25:21,659
We were given power and were born to fulfill a purpose. Isn't our happiness living according to that and being needed by others?

1329
01:25:21,992 --> 01:25:28,374
Doesn't every life have the right to choose its own path?

1330
01:25:28,582 --> 01:25:33,712
This isn't the destiny I desired.

1331
01:25:33,879 --> 01:25:36,423
Is it the princess's wish for this conflict to continue endlessly?

1332
01:25:36,632 --> 01:25:38,884
Is it her desire for everyone to suffer and struggle?

1333
01:25:39,009 --> 01:25:44,306
The princess doesn't understand her own fortune!

1334
01:25:45,224 --> 01:25:49,061
Even though she could rule the world, why won't she accept Orpheus?

1335
01:25:49,812 --> 01:25:55,359
Is that what you want?

1336
01:25:55,693 --> 01:25:57,528
You...

1337
01:25:57,778 --> 01:25:58,529
Huh?

1338
01:25:58,612 --> 01:26:00,739
[Sound of door opening]

1339
01:26:01,156 --> 01:26:02,825
Have you cooled your head?

1340
01:26:03,033 --> 01:26:08,330
It's about time you realized your own mission and took my hand, isn't it?

1341
01:26:08,747 --> 01:26:11,375
No matter how many times you ask, my answer remains the same.

1342
01:26:11,500 --> 01:26:14,128
The one I love is not you.

1343
01:26:15,462 --> 01:26:16,922
Kira Yamato is dead!

1344
01:26:17,006 --> 01:26:18,883
No, he's not dead.

1345
01:26:19,216 --> 01:26:21,260
Why won't you accept the truth!

1346
01:26:21,343 --> 01:26:23,304
Because I believe in him.

1347
01:26:24,555 --> 01:26:26,974
[Sound of falling]

1348
01:26:27,099 --> 01:26:29,518
(Orpheus) Why! Why someone like him...

1349
01:26:29,643 --> 01:26:31,729
A failed product that couldn't become an Accord!

1350
01:26:31,812 --> 01:26:34,523
Because he's the person I decided to love.

1351
01:26:34,607 --> 01:26:39,403
He couldn't create anything you wanted, not even a peaceful world!

1352
01:26:39,528 --> 01:26:42,323
Does someone like that have the right to be by your side?

1353
01:26:42,406 --> 01:26:46,744
Love doesn't have qualifications. Don't you understand?

1354
01:26:52,249 --> 01:26:57,254
Even if you control people with power, you can never control their hearts.

1355
01:26:57,379 --> 01:27:02,259
No matter what you do, you can't erase Kira from within me.

1356
01:27:03,385 --> 01:27:07,973
Why? You were supposed to be born to rule over me and the world!

1357
01:27:08,098 --> 01:27:11,852
But why won't you accept me? My love!

1358
01:27:11,936 --> 01:27:15,981
The "Lacus Clyne" you love isn't me.

1359
01:27:16,106 --> 01:27:16,941
Huh!?

1360
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:21,362
[Sound of door opening]

1361
01:27:23,072 --> 01:27:27,952
I'm heading to the moon. I leave the defense here to you and Shula.

1362
01:27:28,285 --> 01:27:29,203
Yes.

1363
01:27:32,081 --> 01:27:34,041
(Officer) Prime Minister, to the bridge.

1364
01:27:34,333 --> 01:27:37,711
(Orpheus) What are the movements of the Millennium and other hostile fleets?

1365
01:27:37,962 --> 01:27:42,299
(Officer) The remaining fleets of the Orb Moon Fleet and Earth Alliance are heading towards the Requiem.

1366
01:27:42,424 --> 01:27:45,928
They are deploying in the front, and engagement with the ZAFT fleet is anticipated.

1367
01:27:46,220 --> 01:27:48,973
The Millennium is heading towards us on the shortest course.

1368
01:27:49,098 --> 01:27:51,308
Estimated time until encounter: about 4 minutes.

1369
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:56,397
All fleets, form the CW Kroné Wing formation, reverse, and adjust relative speeds.

1370
01:27:56,522 --> 01:28:00,067
Align the twelve-ray positron cannons with the projected course of the enemy ships!

1371
01:28:00,192 --> 01:28:02,820
(Mariu) Bridge shield, first combat deployment.

1372
01:28:02,903 --> 01:28:07,324
(Konoe) With this formation, our positron cannons won't be usable.

1373
01:28:07,741 --> 01:28:12,162
It's okay. We have a new weapon: heat-resistant and shock-resistant crystal armor, deploy!

1374
01:28:18,544 --> 01:28:20,421
Execute Basil Rule tactics.

1375
01:28:20,838 --> 01:28:22,840
(Albert) Missile timing input completed.

1376
01:28:24,341 --> 01:28:26,301
(Mariu) Anti-beam torpedo launch!

1377
01:28:27,511 --> 01:28:32,474
Tristan CIWS Sirius activation, missile launch tubes, Nighthard Disparl loading.

1378
01:28:32,599 --> 01:28:34,768
Full combat speed, break through the center!

1379
01:28:35,227 --> 01:28:36,562
Feuer Fire!

1380
01:28:36,687 --> 01:28:40,649
[Missile, beam, and positron cannon firing sounds]

1381
01:28:43,902 --> 01:28:45,404
They're not evading!?

1382

1728
01:53:42,691 --> 01:53:46,529
(Aura) My children!
Aaaaah...

1729
01:53:46,612 --> 01:53:49,490
I'll burn down Orb and the Plants!

1730
01:53:50,699 --> 01:53:54,828
Why is it always me who has to suffer!
Why can't things ever go right!?

1731
01:53:55,621 --> 01:53:57,373
Are you seriously saying that!?

1732
01:53:57,498 --> 01:54:01,043
You're not even into him
But you're still hanging around with that loser

1733
01:54:01,168 --> 01:54:03,003
You're really enjoying this, aren't you!

1734
01:54:04,755 --> 01:54:07,841
Huh? I like him, sorry!?

1735
01:54:08,133 --> 01:54:11,428
Lies! You like that jerk!?

1736
01:54:12,429 --> 01:54:15,641
It's none of your business!
If I don't like him, why do you care!

1737
01:54:15,724 --> 01:54:19,186
Ugh... Because I
have worth to be loved!

1738
01:54:19,270 --> 01:54:20,479
So what!?

1739
01:54:27,444 --> 01:54:29,822
[Alert sound]
Even I... care about him...

1740
01:54:30,573 --> 01:54:32,408
I'm sorry, Agnes...

1741
01:54:33,534 --> 01:54:35,911
Fire the Tanhauser!

1742
01:54:37,121 --> 01:54:41,125
[Tanhauser firing sound]

1743
01:54:41,584 --> 01:54:43,419
(Mariu) Now! Full speed ahead on both sides!

1744
01:54:43,502 --> 01:54:46,088
Enemy ship, main gun range, Bravo, Mark 31 to 65!

1745
01:54:46,171 --> 01:54:48,048
Target: enemy flagship!

1746
01:54:48,173 --> 01:54:49,675
Crash into it if you have to, bring it down!

1747
01:54:51,635 --> 01:54:56,348
Never forget! The blood shed by the dead, their grudges!

1748
01:54:56,765 --> 01:54:58,809
Never forget!

1749
01:54:59,101 --> 01:54:59,852
Huh!?

1750
01:55:01,854 --> 01:55:02,938
I haven't forgotten...

1751
01:55:08,360 --> 01:55:09,111
Ah!

1752
01:55:16,368 --> 01:55:19,955
That's why, I must stop this now...

1753
01:55:26,253 --> 01:55:28,714
You're strong, Aslan Zara.

1754
01:55:28,839 --> 01:55:29,590
Ugh...

1755
01:55:31,342 --> 01:55:33,886
But still, you're not my enemy.

1756
01:55:34,011 --> 01:55:39,099
Winning is the task given to me,
it's the meaning of my existence!

1757
01:55:40,476 --> 01:55:43,812
It's futile. You can't
close off your thoughts! Huh?

1758
01:55:44,647 --> 01:55:46,482
(Aslan) Kagari!

1759
01:55:47,775 --> 01:55:49,777
Ah!

1760
01:55:50,986 --> 01:55:57,034
You, indulging in such lascivious fantasies
in this sacred battlefield!

1761
01:55:58,994 --> 01:55:59,828
I see!

1762
01:56:02,039 --> 01:56:02,873
What!?

1763
01:56:06,293 --> 01:56:07,836
Idiot! Why!?

1764
01:56:08,170 --> 01:56:09,755
You really are useless.

1765
01:56:16,553 --> 01:56:18,097
Remote control!?

1766
01:56:19,098 --> 01:56:20,974
Lascivious fantasies?

1767
01:56:21,558 --> 01:56:22,643
Aslan!

1768
01:56:22,726 --> 01:56:24,353
You coward!

1769
01:56:28,565 --> 01:56:30,234
Still, I'm superior!

1770
01:56:30,317 --> 01:56:33,862
Strength isn't about power,
it's about the will to live!

1771
01:56:38,033 --> 01:56:39,660
I'm going to lose!?

1772
01:56:45,999 --> 01:56:48,502
Huh!?
Orpheus, Shura!

1773
01:56:48,627 --> 01:56:52,214
Shura...
Damn it, you insects!

1774
01:56:52,297 --> 01:56:55,426
Orpheus, Ingrid,
let's stop this now.

1775
01:56:55,884 --> 01:56:59,430
You chose that man
because he's inferior to you!

1776
01:56:59,722 --> 01:57:03,559
Surrounded by inferior beings,
is it really so pleasant to be worshipped?

1777
01:57:03,642 --> 01:57:04,476
Ugh...

1778
01:57:04,601 --> 01:57:06,478
(Orpheus)
What a selfish and cold woman!

1779
01:57:06,562 --> 01:57:10,899
Are you saying you don't care
if these fools keep fighting and perishing!?

1780
01:57:21,285 --> 01:57:23,537

    Shin!
    Destroy the Requiem!

1781

Bows!

1783
01:57:28,459 --> 01:57:29,251

Lunamaria, use that!

1785
01:57:34,465 --> 01:57:35,507
Let's go, Luna!

1786
01:57:37,009 --> 01:57:37,926
Anytime!

1787
01:57:41,597 --> 01:57:42,973
(Soldier)
Millennium is closing in!

1788
01:57:43,056 --> 01:57:46,977
Fire! Shoot it down!
Is the Requiem ready!?

1789
01:57:47,102 --> 01:57:48,687
(Soldier)
300 seconds until launch!

1790
01:57:50,314 --> 01:57:51,398
Charge!

1791
01:57:51,523 --> 01:57:53,776
Bow, activate the Gouten ramming device!

1792
01:57:53,859 --> 01:57:56,236
All cannons, prepare for close-range loading!

1793
01:57:58,947 --> 01:58:00,949
All hands, prepare for impact!

1794
01:58:02,409 --> 01:58:04,036
Wow! Aahh!

1795
01:58:05,746 --> 01:58:07,831
[Crash sound]

1796
01:58:10,375 --> 01:58:13,545
(Lacus)
There is no superiority or inferiority in life.
Everyone is someone important to someone else.

1797
01:58:13,670 --> 01:58:16,507
Why then am I not loved!?

1798
01:58:19,843 --> 01:58:23,472
No, someone is surely
watching over you.

1799
01:58:23,806 --> 01:58:30,020
Even if not now, someone in the future.
Someone who is so close that you don't notice.

1800
01:58:23,806 --> 01:58:30,020
Even if not now, someone in the future.
Someone who is so close that you don't notice.

1801
01:58:30,145 --> 01:58:30,896
Hah!

1802
01:58:35,234 --> 01:58:38,737
Forget about the future.
I want you now!

1803
01:58:39,613 --> 01:58:42,157
Born out of the foolishness of humanity...

1804
01:58:42,366 --> 01:58:46,286
Claiming peace and equality,
yet demanding others to change

1805
01:58:46,453 --> 01:58:48,664
While refusing
to change themselves!

1806
01:58:49,164 --> 01:58:50,415
That's not true!

1807
01:58:51,083 --> 01:58:53,460
That's why conflict persists
throughout history!

1808
01:58:53,961 --> 01:58:57,297
Harboring grudges,
even on the brink of destruction,

1809
01:58:57,422 --> 01:59:01,385
Clutching onto immediate gains and misconceptions,
dragging each other down!

1810
01:59:01,468 --> 01:59:03,387
Everyone is a fool!

1811
01:59:03,846 --> 01:59:04,805
Orpheus!

1812
01:59:05,347 --> 01:59:07,599
We need someone to lead us!

1813
01:59:07,683 --> 01:59:10,686
To end this history of division
and bloodshed...

1814
01:59:10,811 --> 01:59:12,855
That's the purpose we were born for!

1815
01:59:12,938 --> 01:59:15,816
People are not born out of necessity...

1816
01:59:17,526 --> 01:59:19,027
It is born from love!

1817
01:59:21,280 --> 01:59:23,740
I will choose the future with my own hands!

1818
01:59:30,038 --> 01:59:31,164
Uwaaaa!

01:59:44,720 --> 01:59:45,846
